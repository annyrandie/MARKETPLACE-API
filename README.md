# Marketplace API

Course project HW #9: a contract (`openapi/openapi.yaml`) plus a working
boundary that actually enforces it.

**Chosen variant — B: runtime validation at the boundary.**
`app.js` is an Express server where `express-openapi-validator` validates
every request and every response against `openapi/openapi.yaml`, and an
error handler translates its errors (and our own domain errors) into
`application/problem+json`. Provider verification / a Pact broker
(variant A) were deliberately skipped — for this HW both variants count
equally, and B fits better with what this same server will do in HW #12–14.

## Structure

| File / folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `openapi/openapi.yaml` | contract: 2 resources (`products`, `orders`), 6 operations, cursor pagination, `Idempotency-Key`, `problem+json` |
| `app.js` | Express + `express-openapi-validator` at the boundary, in-memory data |
| `README.md` | this file |

## Resources and operations in the spec

| Method | Path | operationId | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/products` | `listProducts` | list products, cursor pagination |
| POST | `/products` | `createProduct` | add a product |
| GET | `/products/{productId}` | `getProduct` | one product |
| GET | `/orders` | `listOrders` | list orders, cursor pagination |
| POST | `/orders` | `createOrder` | place an order, `Idempotency-Key` required |
| GET | `/orders/{orderId}` | `getOrder` | one order |

All six are implemented (in-memory); the catalog is seeded with three
products (`prod_1`, `prod_2`, `prod_3`) on startup.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm start          # starts the server on :3000, catalog seeded with three products
```

## Verification (acceptance criteria)

Spec is valid:

```bash
npx @redocly/cli lint openapi/openapi.yaml
# exit 0, only warnings allowed (info-license, no-server-example.com)
```

Spec size:

```bash
npx @redocly/cli bundle openapi/openapi.yaml -o spec.json
node -e "const s=require('./spec.json'),M=['get','post','put','patch','delete'];\
const ops=Object.entries(s.paths).flatMap(([p,v])=>Object.keys(v).filter(m=>M.includes(m)).map(m=>[p,m]));\
const idem=ops.flatMap(([p,m])=>s.paths[p][m].parameters??[]).find(x=>x.in==='header'&&/idempotency-key/i.test(x.name));\
console.log('operations:',ops.length,'· resources:',new Set(Object.keys(s.paths).map(p=>p.split('/')[1])).size);\
console.log('Idempotency-Key: required =',idem?.required,'· description length =',(idem?.description??'').trim().length)"
# expected: operations: 6 · resources: 2 · required = true · description length = 393
```

`Idempotency-Key`, `next_cursor`, `problem+json` are declared:

```bash
grep -c 'Idempotency-Key' openapi/openapi.yaml           # ≥ 1
grep -c 'next_cursor' openapi/openapi.yaml               # ≥ 1
grep -c 'application/problem+json' openapi/openapi.yaml  # ≥ 2
```

The server really does reject anything that violates the spec (after
`npm start`, in another terminal):

```bash
# no Idempotency-Key -> 400 problem+json
curl -si -X POST localhost:3000/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"items":[{"product_id":"prod_1","quantity":1}]}'
# HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request, Content-Type: application/problem+json
# detail: "request/headers must have required property 'idempotency-key'"

# empty items -> 400 problem+json
curl -si -X POST localhost:3000/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Idempotency-Key: k1' \
  -d '{"items":[]}'
# detail: "request/body/items must NOT have fewer than 1 items"

# valid request -> 201
curl -si -X POST localhost:3000/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Idempotency-Key: k2' \
  -d '{"items":[{"product_id":"prod_1","quantity":2}]}'
```

### Bonus challenge (no extra points) — implemented

Full `Idempotency-Key` semantics:

```bash
# same key + same body again -> same 201, Idempotency-Replay: true
curl -si -X POST localhost:3000/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Idempotency-Key: k2' \
  -d '{"items":[{"product_id":"prod_1","quantity":2}]}' | grep -i "^HTTP\|idempotency-replay"

# same key, different body -> 422 problem+json
curl -si -X POST localhost:3000/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Idempotency-Key: k2' \
  -d '{"items":[{"product_id":"prod_2","quantity":1}]}'
```

Cursor pagination:

```bash
curl -s "localhost:3000/products?limit=2"
# {"items":[...two products...],"next_cursor":"<opaque token>"}
curl -s "localhost:3000/products?limit=2&cursor=<that token from the previous response>"
# last product, "next_cursor": null
```

## Notes worth knowing

- **Header names in code are always lowercase.** Express (and
  `express-openapi-validator` itself) puts headers into `req.headers` in
  lowercase regardless of how the spec (`Idempotency-Key`) or the client
  wrote them. That's why both the error `detail` and `app.js` consistently
  use `'idempotency-key'` lowercase.
- **`price_cents`/`total_cents` are `integer`, not a decimal string.**
  Money is counted in cents on purpose — a `"2600.00"` string was the pain
  point of v1 from the lecture; this doesn't repeat it.
- **`validateResponses: true` is the enforcement, not the spec by itself.**
  If a handler returned `totalCents` instead of `total_cents`, the
  validator would itself return 500 with
  `detail: "/response must have required property 'total_cents'"` — the
  spec here isn't just documentation, it physically rejects a wrong
  response before it reaches the client.
- **`bundle` without `--dereferenced` doesn't resolve internal `$ref`s.**
  That's why `Idempotency-Key` is described inline right in the
  `POST /orders` operation instead of via `components.parameters` — the
  acceptance-criteria script from the assignment reads `parameters`
  without dereferencing.
